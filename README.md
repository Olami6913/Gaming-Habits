## Dataset Summary
The dataset consists of 1,000 observations describing gaming habits,
sleep behavior, stress, and productivity metrics. No missing values
were detected. The data contains a mix of numerical and categorical
variables, making it suitable for exploratory analysis and predictive
modeling.
