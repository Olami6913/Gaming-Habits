    "# Introduction\n",
    "This dataset explores the relationship between daily and weekly gaming habits and their impact on academic or workplace performance. It captures key behavioral factors such as gaming duration, preferred gaming time, sleep hours, stress levels, focus levels, and productivity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is designed to help analysts, students, and researchers understand how different gaming patterns may positively, negatively, or neutrally influence performance outcomes. It is suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation studies, data visualization, and machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to investigate how gaming habits affect productivity, academic/work performance, and well-being indicators such as sleep, stress, and focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Summary\n",
    "The dataset consists of 1,000 observations describing gaming habits,\n",
    "sleep behavior, stress, and productivity metrics. No missing values\n",
    "were detected. The data contains a mix of numerical and categorical\n",
    "variables, making it suitable for exploratory analysis and predictive\n",
